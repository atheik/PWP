# PWP SUMMER 2020

# ImageNet Browser

This project uses the example Flask API project layout, the introduction to which can be found here:  
https://lovelace.oulu.fi/ohjelmoitava-web/ohjelmoitava-web/flask-api-project-layout/

Namely, the MasonBuilder class and create_error_response function in imagenet_browser/utils.py as well as the submit_data function in client.py, are from the course material as is.

## Setup in development configuration

Download the Cygwin installer:  
https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe

Open a command prompt in the folder that you downloaded the Cygwin installer to and issue the following command:

```cmd
setup-x86_64 -OP git,python37,python37-pip,wget -qs https://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/cygwin/
```

Open a Cygwin terminal from the Start menu and issue the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atheik/imagenet-browser.git
cd imagenet-browser
```

```sh
python3.7 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip3.7 install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
# instance/development.db is already populated and distributed in the repository
# the following ImageNet files are utilized for populating the initial database
wget http://www.image-net.org/archive/words.txt \
     http://www.image-net.org/archive/gloss.txt \
     http://www.image-net.org/archive/wordnet.is_a.txt \
     http://web.archive.org/web/20190130005544/http://image-net.org/imagenet_data/urls/imagenet_fall11_urls.tgz
```

```sh
# only the first 100000 images are used due to repository storage considerations
tar xf imagenet_fall11_urls.tgz
mv fall11_urls.txt{,.full}
head -100000 fall11_urls.txt.full > fall11_urls.txt
```

```sh
export FLASK_APP=imagenet_browser
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask init-db && flask load-db # remove instance/development.db first if you wish to run this command
flask run
```

The entry point is at:  
http://localhost:5000/api/
